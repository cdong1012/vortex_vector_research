Execute.cpp: rd_write line 2316, when writing back to destination register, the vector write is not implemented, so the test fall through. Need to add the case + implement the register writeback

Decode.cpp: simx already implements vector load and store in the fl and sl instruction (line 605-ish in decode.cpp and line 687 in execute.cpp) with the instruction fields being parsed already

Execute.cpp: num_rsrcs process line 129, vector type is not supported. Needed to add case and parse it

Decode.cpp: 226 decode add 1 case for vset.

Execute.cpp: 162 add support for vector type register file set
